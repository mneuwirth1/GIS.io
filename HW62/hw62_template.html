<h1>Homework 6-2: Census Data Ratios and Categories </h1>
<h2>Max Neuwirth</h2>
<h3>These maps show the ratio of the number of residents living in a Virginia county to the number of supermarkets in that county. The number calculated represents the number of residents in the area requiring service from each grocery store in the county (assuming each grocery store services the same number of customers). The darker the green on the map, the more residents expected to be serviced per grocery store. This ratio was created to examine potential food supply issues as the population increases in the state. The count of grocery stores excludes “convenience store” food shops, also focusing on potential food deserts without quality grocery products. It could also be used by grocery chains to determine potential new locations or areas of need. The darkest green counties require more grocery stores to better balance the population.</h3>

<h2>Natural Break Classification</h2>

<h3>Natural break classification uses the mean of the data to break up the data with “natural breaks”. With this form of classification, each color doesn’t have the same range of values which may make the chart misleading. However, it does ensure all colors are used.</h3>

<h2>Equal Count Classification</h2>

<h3>Equal count classification put an equal number of features in each color bin. This can be unhelpful by making it harder to see clusters. As seen on this map compared to the natural break version, the top range is larger, including more data. A positive of this classification is each class is equally represented so it is more visually consistent.</h3>

<h2>Equal Interval Classification</h2>

    </a>
<h3>	Equal interval classification forms bins by keeping the numerical difference between each class the same. In some cases it can be unhelpful as much of the data can fall under one interval, but with this map it makes it easy to view clusters and more accurately review the data.</h3>
