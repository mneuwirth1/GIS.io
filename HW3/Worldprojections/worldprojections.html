    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>After installing the Indicatrix mapper plug-in to QGIS, I imported the naturalearth shapefile. To change the map projection, I changed the render EPSG in the bottom right hand corner of the program. Searching the QGIS database for each EPSG number, I then re-rendered the image using the different projections.  </p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>The WGS84 projection preserves the distance, size, and shape of the middle horizontal portion of the map, while distorting the distance, size, and shape of the northernmost and southernmost points. The northern and southern arctic regions appear enlarged and stretched horizontally.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Aitoff projection represents the Earth as more of an ellipsoid. It preserves the distance, size, and shape in the very center of the map. It distorts the distance, size, and shape at increasing intervals as distance increases from the center. The North and South poles are much closer to their actual size than WGS84 but still are distorted to a degree.</h3>

    <h2>WGS84/Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>Similar to standard WGS84, the distance, size, and shape of the entire middle portion of the map are preserved. The northern and southernmost horizontal parallels are distorted by size and distance, but shape is preserved. There is no stretching of Antarctica or Greenland, rather they appear slightly larger than they are in actuality but with the same shape.</h3>

    <h2>Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Winkel I projection is another ellipsoid projection. The middle section of the map maintains some aspect of shape and distance. Distance and size are distorted at the north and south poles.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>Cylindrical Equal-Area Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Cylindrical Equal-Area projection maintains distance throughout the entire map. Size and shape are all maintained with the exception of the northern and southern-most sections on the map. There is large stretch distortion making the North look smushed and Antarctica look enormously wide.</h3>

    <h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>The Equidistant Conic projection is a “top-down” projection of the Earth. The projection is not a complete sphere. There are consistent rings of shape and and distance moving outward from the center. The image becomes increasingly stretched vertically with each. The most accurate projection occurs around the North pole.
    </h3>

    </a>
    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>The North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection is another top-down style projection of the world. Similar to the Equidistant Conic projection, there are consistent rings of shape and and distance moving outward from the center. Similar patterns of stretching occur as well. Differently, the projection completes the Earth as a sphere. As it is a top-down view, the Sourthern Hemisphere is barely visible and Antarctica is heavily skewed to surround the entire circle.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>South Pole Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
    <h3>The South Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection is a bottom-up style projection of the world. It has the same characteristics as the North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant projection except it is centered around the South Pole. Only Antarctica is projected accurately, while the rest of the world is skewed. The northern hemisphere is skewed heavily and is practically unrecognizable.</h3>

    <h2>WGS84/Adams Square II </h2>
    <h3>The Adams Square II projection preserves shape very well throughout, while size is and distance are inconsistent (bigger the farther from the center of the map. Antarctica looks much larger than it is in reality. While not the best map to determine scale or distance, it may be one of the best for shape.</h3>
